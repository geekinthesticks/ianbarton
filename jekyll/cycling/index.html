Like most people I learnt to cycle when I was a child. I can still
remember, when I was four and a half, a friend removing the
stabilizers from my bike and sending me off across the lawn balanced
on two wheels. Like most thing learning to cycle is easy once you have
done it!

After leaving school I hardly ever cycled. However, in 1990 after
hiring a bike to cycle along the Ashbourne Trail in Derbyshire, I
decided to buy a new bike. All my old bikes had just had the ols three
gear Sturmey Archer system. My new bike was what I would have called a
"racer", with decent derailleur gears. It had a decent frame and
having decent gears transformed my experience of cycling, particularly
in hilly Derbyshire.

I have never been a fanatical cyclist, being quite happy with rides in
the 10 to 50 mile range. However, I do try and go out at least three
times per week.

Cycling is a great family activity. If you have a trailer bike, you
can cycle, even with very young children. As the children get older
one thing I would like to try is cycle touring.

Linked from this page are several family friendly cycle routes that we
have done. Some of these are completely off road. However, we are
lucky to live in the countryside, where the minor roads are relatively
quiet and are generally suitable for family bike rides.
