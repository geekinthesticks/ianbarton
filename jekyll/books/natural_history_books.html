<p>
This book is available as two separate editions. There is a not quite
pocketable version and a large coffee table edition. Both editions
have exactly the same content and differ only in the size of the
pages.
</p>
<p>
There are over 3,500 original paintings showing all the major plumages
for each of the birds illustrated. The text covers size, habitat,
range, identification and voice. Distribution maps provide information
on migration and breeding.

<h3 id="sec-3"><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0002197790/naturenotes-21">Collins Field Guide to Mammals of Britain and Europe</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3">


<p>
This book covers every mammal found in Europe, more than 230
species. As you would expect the book provides taxonomic details and
much additional information to help you to identify mammals. It also
provides an insight on how the various mammals live. Details are given
for mating seasons, gestation periods and feeding habits.
</p>
<p>
The centre of the book contains a series of colour plates, which also
show skulls, tracks and spoors. More detailed drawings of skulls and
teeth would be nice, as these are frequently the only way of
identifying many small mammals.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4">


<p>
I have had a couple of earlier editions of this book on my bookshelf
for more than 20 years. This edition was produced in 2001 and helps to
fill in the gaps in the Collins Field Guide. Animal Tracks and Signs
is geared towards helping you identify mammals by the signs they leave
behind them. The tracks of all the mammmals described are reproduced
life size. There are detailed drawings and dimensions for the skulls
and other bones that can be used in identification.
</p>
<p>
There is an interesting section on Owl pellets and how to identify
their contents. Other sections dscribe feeding signs on seeds fruits
and herbaceous plants.
</p>
<p>
This book is great for dipping in to, or for trying to work out what
might have caused that hole in the ground.

<h3 id="sec-5"><a href="#[[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0723224196/naturenotes-21">The Wild Flower Key</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5">


<p>
If like me you are a complete botanical dunce, this book will help you
to identify any wild flowers you may find. Don't worry if the plant
you want to identify isn't in flower, the guide will still help you to
identify it.
</p>
<p>
The guide covers wild flowers in Great Britain and Northern Europe. It
also includes the common grasses, sedges and rushes. There are more
than 1,000 colour illustrations, each placed opposite the relevant
text description.
</p>
<p>
The '''Key''' is the most useful feature of the guide. If you find a
flower and have no idea of its name you start with the habitat
key. For example if you are in a wood you start at the Woodlands
key. You then work through each level in the key e.g. ''Trees and
taller shrubs'', ''leaves rounded-obovate and as if cut across at the
tip''. This in turn leads you onto the relevant page in the key with
the description and picture of the tree or shrub.
</p>
<p>
If you have some idea of the plants identity, but are not sure of its
precise classification you can jump in at any intermediate point in
the key. This identification system makes the book useful to both
beginners and experts.
