title: Left Fork of Crowberry Gully.

<p>
It was the end of February and the weather had been superb for weeks
(if you wanted to go Winter climbing). Taking advantage of these all
too rare conditions we were off to Scotland for a week, but there was
a slight problem since one member of the team had decided not to come
only half an hour before we left. A visit to the local climbing shop
(well known source of climbing partners) and a few frantic telephone
calls later we managed to fill the spare place in the car with Andy
Cave and set off from Sheffield.
</p>
<p>
After a brief stop in Barnsley to collect some of Andy’s gear, I made
the first navigational error of the holiday and got onto the wrong
road over the Pennines. Driving around in various directions for a
while and finding the roads blocked with snow, we eventually located
the Woodhead road. Our late departure meant that we did not arrive in
our intended bivi site until 3:00 am on Saturday morning. I shall not
reveal the exact location of this three star pit to avoid overcrowding
in future <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. It is enough to say that it
contains all facilities including free electric heating and hot water.
</p>
<p>
Reluctant to quit such a comfortable spot despite the perfect weather
we did not stir from our pits until 8:30 in the morning and enjoyed a
leisurely breakfast at the Onich Hotel before continuing on to
Glencoe. We parked under the Buchaille near Jacksonville. It was now
10 o’clock and it was obvious that we were the last to arrive. The
hordes of other climbers heading for the mountain could be seen
crossing the moor and dotted around the hill. After a quick glance at
the guidebook we decided to go for Crowberry Gully and possibly
attempt the left fork as this sounded more interesting than the
ordinary route.
</p>
<p>
I was resigned to a wait at the end of a queue. However,
Andy Cave was very fit and set off across the moor with the snow
parting like the Red Sea in front of him. Plattso and I followed
gasping in his slipstream. Such was our speed that by the time
we arrived at the foot of the gully, we were second in the queue.
Conditions were perfect, the gully was filled with neve and the
main pitches were well banked up. Unlike normal Glencoe weather
there was not a breath of wind. Out of breath and hardly able to
speak we caught up with Andy as he paused for a while to put on
crampons. This was accomplished all too quickly and we set off up
the gully at the same fast pace. The climbing was easy and we
were soon at the foot of the Thin Crack Chimney which was covered
in perfect neve and easy.
</p>
<p>
We reached an situ peg belay below a short pitch
leading to the Junction. It was decided to rope up and I balanced
on the slope trying to extract gear from my sack whilst not
dropping anything. Despite being in this situation many times
before, I never seem to have learnt to gear up at the bottom of
climbs. Eventually the tangle was sorted out and I lead up to a
stance below the Junction where the party in front were already
ensconsed. The Junction itself looked easy with the traverse well
plastered.
</p>
<p>
Tying on to the in situ peg I was held a brief
conversation with the two climbers already hanging from this
rusty old relic. The second on this rope revealed that he had
done the route once before 35 years ago. The leader was an
American who admitted to 65 years and was just in Scotland for a
weeks climbing. As he set off his companion mentioned that he was
a retired airline pilot who was able to travel anywhere in the
world first class. Turning green with envy I thought of spending
wet Sundays in Yosemite instead of Stoney cafe. As I brought the
other two up to the stance the jet-setting OAP was already up
the icy chimney directly above the stance ignoring the easier
traverse line and was soon lost to view.
</p>
<p>
Leaning out on the belay I could see the chockstone of the
left-hand branch looming above. In the Cicerone guide book this
is simply described as a hard, but well protected technical
problem. However, the definitive SMC guidebook gives a much more
inspiring description (read it for yourself). The chockstone crux
did indeed look formidable and I was glad that it was not my
lead. When Andy and Plattso arrived I handed over the gear and
Andy started up the first pitch round a small chockstone. By
this time several other teams had arrived below us intent, on the
ordinary route and at one stage there were six of us suspended
from the in situ peg.
</p>
<p>
One poor unfortunate who could not quite fit onto the stance
felt the full benefit of the spindrift which Andy was dislodging
from above. One particularly well directed shower going down
his neck as he leant forward. Shouts from above indicated that
Andy had gone the wrong way around the first chock and that there
was a much easier through route underneath. Since reversing down
to the stance was difficult, he decided to continue and after some
delay was established in the spacious cave below the crux.
</p>
<p>
Following up the chock it was easy to see what had caused the
delay. After an initial nasty little groove which established me
a cheval on top of the chock it was necessary to attain a
standing position and traverse across one wall of the gully to
get established below a small overhang, above which an easy snow
slope lead to a cave. The traverse across the wall involved the
possibility of a plummet into the depths behind the chockstone should
I come off before the overhang.
</p>
<p>
Communicating this state of affairs in a worried tone to Plattso
below, he decided on the much more sensible course of untying so that
I could drop the rope down to him behind the chock. Thus he would
neatly avoid this section. The snow on the chock and the wall above
was like sugar and I had to hook my axes behind small flakes of rock
to gain any purchase. Attaining a standing position on the chock was
hard and the following move to gain the gully wall even
harder. Carefully scraping away snow with an axe to reveal small holds
I began to teeter accross. On a couple of occasions a foothold
collapsed, but I was just able to stay in balance and finally managed
to get into a much more secure bridging position below the
overhang. The snow above this was good and with a big heave on well
planted axes I was onto the snowslope and trotting up to the cave.
</p>
<p>
Having cunningly avoided the nasty traverse, Plattso came quickly up
the pitch and we all stood in the cave contemplating the crux above.
This looked desperate, initially a narrow cleft lead up below the
capstone, where a leftwards traverse to gain a strip of thin ice
leading the capstone, to what we hoped was easy ground. The initial
cleft was covered in verglas and the leftwards traverse appeared
devoid of both holds and ice.
</p>
<p>
However, a large amount of in situ gear boosted confidence as Andy began
climbing. Progress could be made initially by bridging up the
walls, until an awkward move lead to a good resting place in a
niche. From here back and footing allowed a large hold to be
grasped with the right hand. Hanging from this Andy tried to
reach the ice out to his left, but his crampons scraping in the
verglas were unable to gain a purchase. A long sling hung down
from one end of the capstone but being ethical (unlike me) he
avoided using this. Eventually deciding that a point of aid was
needed Andy hooked the sling with one axe and swung across to get
established on the ice leading past the capstone. It was
possible to rest here in classical back and footing position
before the final strenuous pull around the capstone and an
announcement that there was only 30 feet of easy snow to a col.
</p>
<p>
Soon the rope went tight and it was my turn to start climbing. I
had decided that the first section would succumb to rock rather
than ice climbing techniques, so had parked my axes
in their holsters. Although I was able to climb relatively
quickly with the security of a top rope, by the time I arrived in
the resting position below the final capstone I had lost all
feeling in my hands. I stayed crouched like a gnome contemplating
my fate while I rewarmed them. Taking my axes out, I shuffled
up and managed to hook the sling under the roof. Swinging across
onto the ice I attempted to pull up but my rucksack had become
entangled on something behind me (modern sacs with side tensioning
straps are definitely not made for thrutching about in icy
chimneys) and I could move neither up or down. After requesting a
tight rope a few minutes of random thrashings followed which
eventually dislodged me and the sac and I pulled gasping round
the capstone and climb up to the col.
</p>
<p>
Glad to escape I waited whilst Plattso began to climb. I had left in a
few pieces of gear to assist his progress ( being too gripped to
remove them myself). Various gruntings could be heard from below as
Plattso thrutched up the slippery slot. Eventually we heard a louder
grunt and interpreted this as a request for a tight rope.
Unfortunately, Plattso was at the wrong end of the difficult traverse
to reach the sling with the rope going horizontally away from him
round the chockstone. Predictably the tight rope pulled him off and
with a loud shout of “You bastards” and an impressive clatter he swung
across under the capstone. This manoeuvre had left him out of reach of
the strip of ice underneath the capstone and some hefty winching was
necessary to bring him over the top. Eventually a pair of axes waving
like tentacles appeared over the overhang, soon followed by the rest
of Plattso. Like me, interment in the icy slot below had frozen his
hands and he spent some time rolling in agony up on the col with the
hot aches, while the circulation returned. No sympathy was forthcoming
from the rest of the party who produced cameras to photograph the
spectacle.
</p>
<p>
Our knowledge of the topography of the mountain was such
that we thought the climb emerged low down on Curved Ridge ( in
fact it comes out at Crowberry Tower) and that the summit was
still miles away. So we were pleasantly surprised to reach the
top after only a few hundred feet and celebrated by lounging
around in the sun before ambling back to the car and a well
deserved pint.
